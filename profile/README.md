# CrossCopy

## Intro

CrossCopy is a software created and maintained by [HuakunShen](https://github.com/HuakunShen).

The goal is to create a realtime syncing clipboard providing seamless integration on all major platforms 
with open source softwares and easily deployable by anyone using docker in a single command.

I plan to support the following platforms (in the order)
- CLI for Windows, Linux, MacOS
- Web
- Desktop (most likely support altogather with some cross platform framework)
  - Windows
  - Linux
  - MacOS
- ChromeOS (if I will have one by then)
- Android
- IOS
- HarmonyOS

Basically, user will get a universal clipboard without even feeling the existence. 

`Ctrl + C` on one device and `Ctrl + V` on another, without opening an app or doing any manual work, just like on the same device.

## Contribution Guidelines

The project is currently under development, and is close to beta stage. The project will be open source and free for non-commercial use.

The main repos will be public once the code is stable. Anyone is welcomed to contribute, there will be more details later.
